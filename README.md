# ðŸŽ¬ Quadratic Function
Through this project, I created a video about quadratic function using Python and the library [Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) which generates mathematical animations

In the directory above you will find  code that leverages Manim's classes and functions to generate short mathematical animations. I then assembled these animations to create a youtube video



## What did I learn **?**

- Built knowledge aroundobject-oriented programming and its implementation in Python
- Learned advanced features: `filter()`, `map()`, `isinstance()`, `itertools` ...
- Used VSCode efficiency in order to quickly understand the Manin library

## Why this project ?

By pure curiosity! I've always been a big fan of [3b1b](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown) videos, youtuber specialized in the popularization of mathematical concepts. By the way, I advise you to have a look at his series on [linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) or the one on [analysis](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr): real nuggets!  He is the creator of Manim. I was simply curious to see behind the scenes and create my own animations. 

By spending time discovering the code of other programmers, I want to improve my ability to produce  beautiful code: easy to understand for other programmer and scalable! That's why I decided to get the book [Clean code](https://www.amazon.fr/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882).
<br>

**Update:** I started to apply the concepts of the book a little later in [this project](https://github.com/axelearning/REST-authentication-API)
